<h1>Professional-Gamer</h1>

<p>If you've never encountered the term "professional gamer," you might be perplexed as to what it actually entails. A professional gamer dedicates their entire day to playing video games and participates in competitions to win prizes. When professional gamers compete, sponsors or marketers pay them, and occasionally they work with other players to form a team. 
Professional gamers concentrate on enjoying the games, not making them, in contrast to those who engage in the videogame industry, such as designers or game testers. Pro players spend many hours researching and honing their chosen game until they are proficient enough to compete in it. They frequently invest several hours honing crucial abilities including kinesthetic awareness, quick thinking, and dilemma abilities.
