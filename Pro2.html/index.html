<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hello, my name is Camron, and this page is about my favorite games. I really liked gaming at your age, and I've always been passionate and competitive about it, so this page or site is just an overview of my past history or my dream of becoming a professional gamer.
</p>

<h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
    <p class="Pie">I was initially a little unsure of what I needed to accomplish for the project or which theme would be the most obtrusive when "video games" suddenly came to me. That's the thing: I like how it has this simplicity to it, despite the fact that it seems plain and somewhat banal. I thought, "Why not let's make a page about video games?" It is a pretty broad topic and has been around for a while. I was pleased with how my part's form section turned out and how I included a gif background image to make it look triumphant or successful. I would definitely think about working on this project again.Â observations or lessons- Yes, but one lesson I found intriguing and even a bit confusing was formatting a responsive page, which was tricky at first, but when I read and researched more about it, it became a lot simpler and i even had something new in my arsenal just in case if i had to reflect on this lession once more.Reflection- I saw HTML and CSS in a new light; it was much clearer and better instructed when I last took it, and I now know what to do and what not to do, which is nice on my part.</p>
